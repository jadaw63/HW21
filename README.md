# HW21
This homework was modeled after the Arcadetoken exercise in class. After using the template files, add the constructor parameters to the PupperCoinSale, uint rate, address payable wallet, PupperCoin token, uint256 goal, uint open and uint close (for the time). I added all of the constructors that are used and their parameters.

I had problems compiling because I added 'PupperCoin' as an inherited contract, be sure to inherit the correct contracts before declaring the constructor.
In the new PupperCoinSale list the parameters as they are in order on the PupperSale contract. List the represented value of the open and close times. 

Ultimately, the code did compile but I could not get my contract to deploy, however I took a screenshot of the Deploy & Transactions tab in Remix.
